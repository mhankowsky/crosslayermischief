\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Metrics}
We will consider three metrics when evaluating the results of our experimentation: sensor data, control signals and packet throughput.
\subsubsection{Sensor Data}
We consider Sensor Data because this includes crucial data about what is actually occurring in the simulated plant process (Tennessee-Eastman, in this case).
\subsubsection{Control Signals}
We consider the Control signals because these signals are meant to be directing the process, and how they react when parameters of the simulation are changed a crucial to our understanding of how various attacks effect our simulation.
\subsubsection{Throughput}
We use the packet throughput as an evaluation metric because this data is extremely relevant in denial of service type attack we have implemented.
