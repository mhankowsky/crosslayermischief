\section{Future Work}
A large goal of this project was to develop a framework that would enable further research to be done in this space.  What we've provided makes it very easy to develop different network configurations for corresponding process simulations in Matlab.  There are three major fields of further work that we propose: extending the framework, experimenting with more attacks and validating configurations.  

\subsection{Extending the Framework}
The framework is functionally complete, but there are additions that could be made.  More modules could be adapted to support a greater range of network simulations.  The addition of primitives to support cryptography, or at the least simulated cryptography, would enhance the realism of this framework and allow for truer to life attacks.

\subsection{Experimentation}
A large body of future work could easily consist of just experimentation with different types of misbehavior and exploitation.

\subsection{Validation and Research}
It would be valuable to do further research into the common configurations of networked control systems in industry.  This information would certainly help focus future experimentation and development.
