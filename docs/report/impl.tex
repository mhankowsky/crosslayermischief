\subsubsection{Tennessee Eastman}
  We buit a custom simplified Tennesee Eastman model in MATLAB.  
  This was based off of a preexisting FORTRAN model, but was
  reimplemented in MATLAB for ease of use and reduced complexity 
  \citation{Ricker}.  Our model contains variable vectors, an
  input vector, a state vector, and an output vector. Then by 
  using the equations provided in Ricker\citation{Ricker}, the
  simulation simply takes in the input vector from OMNeT++, and
  outputs the output vector, which includes the sensor data, to
  OMNeT++ via the MATLAB bridge.
