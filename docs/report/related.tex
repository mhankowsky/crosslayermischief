\section{Related Work}
There are a number of academic publications that we've referenced to gain a better understanding of the space we've developed in.  The topic of cybersecurity has been examined in the following fields and we're going to go into more depth examining these works.  We've looked at the general fields of: Networked Control Systems, Cyber-Physical Security, and Cross-Layer Mischief. 
\subsection{Networked Control Systems}
The academic community has developed a number of research papers on the topic of security in networked control systems.  However, there are two that are most relevant to learn from for our work.  The survey of security in wireless sensor networks and the examination of adversary models for networked control systems. \cite{chen,cardenas}
\subsection{Cyber-Physical Security}
Many solutions have been proposed to solved the problems the current model of security presents \cite{mclaughlin, beitollahi}.  Process control security \cite{hashimoto}  Process consulted, Tennessee-Eastman challenge. \cite{ricker} EPIC, testbed for cyber physical systems. \cite{siaterlis}  Smartgrid Infrastructure \cite{mo}
\subsection{Cross-Layer Mischief}
Networked control systems under DoS attacks \cite{amin} and more specifically in ad hoc networks \cite{radosavac} Surveys of less common attacks, like service authentication broken by timing attacks\cite{hayes}
We have examined many different attacks and their mitigations, including replay attacks \cite{mosinopoli}
There is a large body of research that we have drawn upon.
