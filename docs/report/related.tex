\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Networked Control Systems}
The security of wireless sensor networks has been surveyed \cite{chen}.  Examination of adversary models for networked control systems. \cite{cardenas}
\subsection{Cyber-Physical Security}
Many solutions have been proposed to solved the problems the current model of security presents \cite{mclaughlin, beitollahi}.  Process control security \cite{hashimoto}  Process consulted, Tennessee-Eastman challenge. \cite{ricker} EPIC, testbed for cyber physical systems. \cite{siaterlis}  Smartgrid Infrastructure \cite{mo} Embedded Systems \
\subsection{Cross-Layer Mischief}
Networked control systems under DoS attacks \cite{amin} and more specifically in ad hoc networks \cite{radosavac} Surveys of less common attacks, like service authentication broken by timing attacks\cite{hayes}
We have examined many different attacks and their mitigations, including replay attacks \cite{mosinopoli}
There is a large body of research that we have drawn upon.
